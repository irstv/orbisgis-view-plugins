Here, you can:
* search plugins thanks to the engine,
* filter all, installed or updatable plugins,
* add a plugin from an url / from the disk (in both cases, dependancies will not be automatically resolved),
* add/remove/update a remote bundle repository,
* download/start/stop/update/uninstall a plugin.


## Code organization

A plugin is a jar bundle that contains the following structure:
* ```src``` folder : the source code,
* ```pom.xml``` file : configuration file for MAVEN (dependancies, ...),
* ```README.md``` file : the plugin's documentation in english. Optionnaly, you can have additionnal README_XX.md file for XX translation,
* ```img``` folder : potential images shown in the documentation.
